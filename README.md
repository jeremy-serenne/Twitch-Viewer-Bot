<h1 align="center">âœ¨ Twitch Chat Manager âœ¨</h1>

*TwitchChatManager* is a command line interface that allows users to interact with the chat of a Twitch channel.

It is designed to:
> - send pre-made messages using commands,
> - retrieve chat history,
> - automate certain tasks such as responding to certain keywords or phrases in the chat,
> - more coming soon (setup daily messages)

> **Warning** : It is not intended to be used to artificially inflate view count or engagement on a Twitch channel and should be used in compliance with Twitch's terms of service and community guidelines.
